With the help of this project, we will learn how to set up and connect to the cloud database.
Effectively, we will learn how to persist our data to the cloud.
We will also learn how to perform all the CRUD operations.

Routes:
app.get('/api/v1/tasks')        – get all the tasks
app.post('/api/v1/tasks')       – create a new task
app.get('/api/v1/tasks/:id')    – get a single task
app.patch('/api/v1/tasks/:id')  – update a task
app.delete('/api/v1/tasks/:id') – delete a task

MongoDB:
– NoSQL, non-relational DB
– Store JSON
– Easy to get started
– Free cloud hosting – Atlas
